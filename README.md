- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
-  Node.js + Express (backend)
-  Local JSON file (`employees.json`) for data persistence

Challenges Faced

Ensuring that client-side form validation and server-side persistence worked seamlessly
Preventing stale data after redirect without triggering error messages
Managing correct routes for both static files and backend API endpoints

Future Improvements

Upload employee photos with preview
Role-based permissions
Use Freemarker or template engine for server-side rendering if required
